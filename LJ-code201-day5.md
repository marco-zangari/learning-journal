Lots of help today. I was not able to finish my five questions, for lab-5 assignment. However, I made some good progress in thinking about variables, functions.

The git training was a great way to start the day. I know, that it was helpful to work through the process of moving between local and repository. I was talking to someone tonight who was laughing at me for stressing so much about flipping between github and my local system. He was saying at his company they use perforce. I need to look up whether perforce is similar. A quick internet search says, maybe.

Again I don't think I would have made it through today's work without a lot of support from Rob, Chelsea, Gabe, Shannon, Brian, and Max.

Thanks also to Jim. He got me over a hurdle. I was getting too tired to see what was happening in my code, especially on question 3 of lab-5. I was not passing a value to a sum and it was messing with the operation of my function. He showed me that I needed to assign a value that I hadn't. And then showed me how it could work. I really like(d), how he has a focus on figuring out what you need to do to solve what is in front of you. YES!
