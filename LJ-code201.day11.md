The day started with such promise; with such UGHHH, did it end.

Let's cut right to the lab. I really followed the problem domain well. I built out what I wanted to happen. I was ready to work my plan. I had a near perfect set up with git, github. My files were looking good. I wrote my user profiles: dev team, market research team, and focus group. And then started to build a constructor function. And then made a random number generator and then the wheels fell off. I constructed a for loop to work to be axed and a while loop to be axed, all for the purpose of getting my initial three images onto the page. I made the decision to do each step, i.e. work from one image to the next, but ran out of time before I could really see it to the end.

The bright side is that I feel like I got better at testing what I was making. That felt good, even though, what I was making, was not working. Ever onwards!

re: key indices of janky: on css, doing something that is easily available through another application, but use CSS to make a simple thing really complicated. position absolute. float everything 'left'. id'ing everything. what is 'important' in CSS?

set color on a link.

iframe embeds another website in your website, aka this is what happens when you use the embed feature in youtube for instance. working with the video, try to keep the same aspect of what is there. so 500x200 keep that ratio if you make smaller or bigger.

remove event listener. see MDN target.removeEventListener(type, listener[, options]);
