Long day. We came in with a plan to work on the CSS and to put graphs on the results page of our CFStudy project. The graphs were a stretch goal that we had and the CSS was really necessary. We had also isolated a series of small-ish projects, a punchlist of sorts, to get through before the end of the day. We were pretty clear that we did not want to fiddle with anything on Friday. 9.30 was our time to stop fiddling.

During our CSS work-session, we all started to ride each other too hard. And we somewhat forgot how to be good team members: empathetic, generous, and at times recognizing that it's better to walk away as a group before an escalation than to try to push through.

We were able to keep our main goal of producing a solid project. YEAH!

Therefore what I learned today was that sometimes it's better to see that progress is not really happening and that it will probably take far less time to walk away and to reconvene at a set time.
