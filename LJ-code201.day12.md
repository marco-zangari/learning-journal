Solid day today. My wireframing from yesterday was still good. Even though I needed to scrap some concepts of what I was wanting to do, I was able to add some techniques: the while loop and how to store arrays with a variable that I either hadn't used before (the while loop) or hadn't used in a while (storing variables).

I was not psyched to go to the information meeting for an hour, it broke the flow that I had - it was the difference between installing an event listener or not. Still the session was informative. I got pretty interested in Python for the reason that data excites me. Wrangling data and analyzing it, is pretty much one of the main reasons I'm learning how to code. Data visualization is pretty awesome too! Still learning c is a draw. It seems far off, yet it's never to early to plan.....
