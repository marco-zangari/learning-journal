Code review was good. I had a couple of aha moments - small ones, mind you - but little pieces were starting to come together. The event handler was starting to make more sense. I was beginning to see a future where a piece like an event listener could be dropped in with (greater) ease than the slow-death that it feels like now. I apologized to David for not helping him more today, especially during his work in code review. At least afterward, during the ten minute break directly afterward, we talked through what he had just done. I think it may have helped to simply walk through what he produced, in front of the class, one more time. It's hard for me - right now - to get out of teacher mode and be a better fellow. I'm working on it. It's important to me.

Pair work was great. Kinley has such fantastically nuanced way of producing code. It's so great to read through their lines and see problems being solved. It's very much their own. We were able to piece through what I had and get it almost over the finish line. No local storage yet, but almost have the clicker totally working and the charts up running.
