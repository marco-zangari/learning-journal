Today I learned how not to cry too hard in public. Day two of the process to learn something completely new has been as hard as I had thought it was going to be. However, simply because something is as expected does not make it any easier.

Many successes were had. I think I finally might have figured out how git hub, my computer GUI, and my terminal are in communication. Or rather I think I have figured out how to use them so that I have more ordered files. There is something deeply ironic about being somewhat maniacal about my files (I'm old enough to have remembered using actual files) whether in file cabinets or on my computer, yet not being in control of them at this time. I'm getting there, but it has shaken me. Hence why the tears.

The project for day 2, a simply three page set up with an html, js, and css file could have gone much better. I was pleased with the js component of it. I was able to make the operators operate. I think that is the right word. That is to say, I made the if, else if, else statements work. However, I am still rather hazy on what the console.log function will get me really. Yes, it puts something onto the console. But I am already putting something onto the console when I have made the if/conditional. I think I may need to play around more with this project.

That sentiment, of having to revisit the projects putatively completed, most likely is going to be on heavy repeat throughout the rest of the class.
