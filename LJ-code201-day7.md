Code review was extremely helpful this morning. Nick called on me to explain a function. Though I did poorly on the answering of it, i.e. I was not able to answer as fully as I would have liked, and was not able to articulate exactly how to construct the function - UGHHH!, in my mind it was clear! - there was real progress made over the course of that interaction and the hour plus time that was spent going over the lab from the previous day.

I also was able to give help, help that had a tangible impact in so far it was to someone, who was blocked, and then was able to move on. That felt great. Looking forward to being able to help more.

Some bummers. I need to keep pace more with the work so that it does not all cascade into the weekend.

Two goals: I'd like to tackle one of the stretch goals before the week is through. I've yet to be able to do that. And I'd like to plan out what kinds of projects would be interesting to work on for week four.
