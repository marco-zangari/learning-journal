To drink a glass of water was a good decision. Before getting started with the day in class, I drank a glass of water to steady the nerves. It's something that I have done since graduate school. Some people need caffeine or other stimulants to get them focused or attentive. For me, for some reason, what really steadies the nerves and gathers my attention is water.

Today was my first chance to parse line by line someone else's code during lecture / demonstration time, 9.00 to 10.30 typically. It's an exciting time really. People share their work and others get to see how another works through problems and oftentimes solves them. It's really cool. So I was able to offer my commentary on what was going on. Nick gave me a few lines to articulate. It was not as easy as I thought it was going to be. I was pretty bad at it. Still I muddled through what was happening even if I gave a poor explanation of float, something about relative space...which is really not what float is about. Instead of should have said something like float allows you to control where an element stays, i.e. out of the normal flow of the other elements. Next time, I'll have a better idea.

We then looked at functions. I'm starting to recognize them. Or rather I am starting to recognize that the js syntax is different than mathematical syntax (and is certainly different than academic syntax). It's really wild to think how my brain will etymologically think through a problem or even revert back to high school math to puzzle through something.

Working in pairs was great. Max was fantastic. He is so methodical and careful. A true coder. I really felt honored to be around him while he worked. I hope that I conveyed as much joy in his skills as he deserved. The exercise itself of driver / navigator could not have come at a better time.

Thank you, Nick, for resolving a small yet vexing problem on my terminal. From that point, Max and I were moving along swimmingly. Thanks also to Brian today for helping me through configurations of terminal. It should have happened on day one but better later in the week than never. A big shout out also to Liz for helping through early morning git jitters. She diagnosed where I was having problems and got me through my first rm (remove) operation in the terminal. I so appreciate the patience and generosity.
