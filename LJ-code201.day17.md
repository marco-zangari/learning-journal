Group dynamics shaped the day. We may have turned a corner with our group being able to work together. I think in particular, during our stand-up, Brianna, Jim, and Nick were especially helpful in putting into perspective where we were as a team and how we might better work together: have an order of operations for when we do things especially with JS and work more collaboratively. There was more said and it was all good, but I cannot remember it as vividly as I would like. There was something about operating on the principle of generosity in there; it was well-taken and timely since we had also been referencing that very thing. The day went more smoothly once we respectfully aired our grievances. Fancy that!

I had wished that we had been able to address more of our stretch goals in the afternoon. However, I think that after what we had put ourselves through as a group, and then really got after it to deploy a working site on gh-pages, we were too exhausted to do much more. When three-quarters of us wandered off to Ratio, for a CF event, the day was more or less called early.
