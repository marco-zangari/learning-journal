Solidified how to use git functions, branching, githubing, or at least felt very comfortable doing it. There was no problem in the set up of my new repository or its branches. That felt good.

I felt like I had a good understanding of literal objects. That was not necesarily the case once I started to make them. I was able to understand the properties and that functions become methods. But it take way too long for me to realize that one is not able to call a methods from outside the object into a function. That is to say I was having a really hard time distinguishing between what should be out of my object and what should run in the object. I'll sort that out soon.

I spent all of my time looking at the javascript and not any time looking at the CSS and the html. That is problematic because I need to start at least playing around on the daily with those things so that they become easier. They will not be so, if I postpone that work for tomorrow, every day.

Lastly today was a long day. Stayed until 11.10. Ran all the way to third and pike. It felt great to run, even with all the weight of the books, after staring at my screen.
