What I learned today. Mob coding is awesome. We tweaked the model some. We came up with an innovative - perhaps - way to go through the making of a function. We made a hybrid of driver | navigator, pair-programming, and sudo coding practices to produce a really long function, the scoreMaker function, that is basically the heart of our project. It was great to make something entirely together. The energy, and understanding, for everyone was fantastic. It's one of the highlights of the code fellows experience so far.

What did I learn, I learned what an actual pull party is. I was thinking of it as some third party accountability measure. And it is. But even more importantly it is about having the entire team really take a look at what has been done. Everyone looks at one screen and says, ok, I know what is going on in each individual spot. That was eye-opening.
