Really tired today. During the presentations, which were fantastic, the 401 presentation on the skateboards, I fell asleep. I just could not stay awake. Again the work was incredible, but the week simply caught up to me.

The lab time, working on Chocolate Pizza, was really great. I was finally able to make it through some CSS, basic things, but still making it through. Gabe was fantastic and patient. Working through the dev tools was really what was great. Finally using the dropper for color, even though I could not make it work, was exciting.

I am ready to enter the weekend, to get the work done that I was not able to fulfill over the week.
